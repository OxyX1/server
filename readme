# possumCS 

possumCS is a credentials system built from scratch using Python. I found OAuth0 too complex, so I decided to create a stable and secure credentials system.

possumCS will include sub-APIs that allow developers to implement secure authentication for their websites. In some cases, you may want to restrict access to your site, ensuring only authenticated users can view it. possumCS provides the tools to enforce such restrictions seamlessly.
